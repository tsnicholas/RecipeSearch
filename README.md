# API Information
The API I used for this project is themealdb's API. It doesn't require an API id, signup, or anything. You can use the API key of "1" to use the free version of their API. However, there is a paid version of the API where you get more features. The only limitation is that I can't make over 300 requests per minute which is very reasonable.
